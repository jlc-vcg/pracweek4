            <p>Rosmino, Claudio. “Japan’s Technology Leads the Way in Caring for the Elderly.” Euronews, 29 Oct. 2019, <a href="www.euronews.com/next/2019/10/29/japan-leads-the-way-with-elderly-care.">Source</a></p>

                <h4>There are a lot of elderly people.</h4>
                <p>A trend that is observed recently in developed areas of the world is the natural decrease in population, and the increasing aging population.</p>
                <p>While people are living longer and longer, this can also be a major challenge to the healthcare system for a country.</p>
                <p>Japan, however, has decided to find digital methods to solve this problem.</p>
                <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                <p>Japan's recent efforts are on anonymously processed patient data; data such as blood pressure or heartrate are sent to the hospital.</p>
                <p>This data can then be uploaded to the servers by the nurse, which allows a greater amount of data which will make medical care effective and precise.</p>
                <p>The best part is that the patient does not need to go to the nearest hospital for such data to be collected - this is all done in the morning in their bedrooms.</p>

                <h4>AI Navigated Wheelchairs</h4>
                <p>Many elderly people suffer from immobility as their legs aren't quite what they were like years before.</p>
                <p>While traditional wheelchairs are useful, it has the critical flaw that it requires another person to push it.</p>
                <p>And although electric wheelchairs solve the problem, the slower reaction timing of the elderly tend to lead to accidents with electric wheelchairs.</p>
                <p>There is also the risk of the person getting lost while driving around on their wheelchair.</p>
                <p>Therefore with automated driving, users of AI-Navigated wheelchairs will arrive to their destination in the most efficient route, and without running anyone over.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How does this help the young people in any way?</h3>
            <p>Firstly, getting these tasks automated means that less people are needed to care for the elderly.</p>
            <p>This means less tax money goes to the elderly and more towards things that require monetary solutions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, computer science students like us have more jobs when we graduate.</p>
