## Quality of Written Presentation

## Evidence of Collaboration

 - **Author info**
   * No author info on pages
   * authors.html only has one author and is self-authored 
   * **Unacceptable**
 - **Balanced contribution from members**
   * Mostly balanced
   * *Oliverlloyd6204* only made 1 commit, with the barebones recycling page (15 lines).
   * **Very Good**
 - **Not completed at the last minute**
   * Commits are evenly space across assignment duration
   * Some small last minute fixes
   * **Exemplary**

Overall Score: **Good**
